## About the Series

Welcome to the first Part of a Series of Tutorials called **Real-time Applications with Go and ReactJS**. We build a Live Dashboard that Monitors Servers and receives Webhooks by GitlabCI (or any CI really), rendering this Data live to every Client that is connected **without any delay**.

After the Series, this is what the App will look like:

![https://public.headt.rip/github/hetzner/realtime-tutorial/preview.gif](https://public.headt.rip/github/hetzner/realtime-tutorial/preview.gif)

We are going to cover every step from an empty text editor to configuring your CI for the dashboard and deploy the docker container we build.

### Technologies covered

-   GoLang for the Server
-   HTTP/2 and Server-Sent Events (SSE)
-   ReactJS for the Client
-   Docker for Building the App and Deploying it

#### Additional Information: Definition of `real-time` in Computing

At reviewing the Tutorial with my Colleague @schaeferthomas, he stated that "real-time" could be understood in different ways. For this Tutorial I use it in the context of Public Networking Applications using the following definition:

> \[adjective\] (real-time)Computation of or relating to a system in which input data is processed within milliseconds so that it is available virtually immediately as feedback, e.g., in missile guidance or airline booking system.
> 
> -   Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English

## Introduction: Building a Realtime HTTP Server

**Prerequisites**

-   Basic Networking Knowledge
-   Basic Knowledge of HTTP
-   Some experience in Parallel or Concurrent Programming
-   Minimal Knowledge of Go
    
If you did not yet have any contact with golang, no worries, I am not going to dive deep into the mechanics of golang. You should be able to follow even if you haven't used golang yet. However, wouldn't that be a great time to make the first contact with Go?

> To Follow Along without any Knowledge in golang, I recommend using [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com) as a reference.


### What we are going to build in this part

We are going to use the core `net/http` package to build a very basic real-time server that keeps connections to an endpoint `/listen` alive and takes input at `/say`.

Success       [ratio]                  100.00%
```

> Conclusion: Go is tremendously fast at doing stuff not necessarily in parallel but in concurrency.


### Compiler

Code goes to `main.go`, create it:

```bash
touch main.go
```

Then add the template for our Application in your favourite editor:

```go
package main

import "log"

func main() {
        log.Println("Starting with Go")
}
```

You need a golang compiler. For development, I would [**recommend installing golang**](https://golang.org/dl/) and using the builtin development compiler.

```bash
go run main.go
```

Alternative: Build with Docker (NOT recommended, go run is faster in dev)

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app -e GOOS=$(uname -s | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]') golang:1.12-alpine go build main.go
```
Then execute with

```bash
./main
```


## Step 1 - Implementing the `/say` Handler 

Starting an HTTP Server in Go is very straight forward. The [core package `net/http`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http) provides the `ListenAndServe(address string, handler Handler)` function. The Function runs till it may receive an unrecoverable error, returning the Error message. Since it is Blocking, you should add the Statement at the end of `func main`.

```go
log.Fatal( http.ListenAndServe(":4000", nil) )
```

We implement HTTP Handlers with the `http.HandleFunc(urlPattern string, handlerFunction Handler)` Function. It takes a Pattern that describes the URL, in our example `/say` and a Callback Function that is going to execute on any request to that URL.

The Callback function receives a `ResponseWriter` interface which has a `Write([]byte])` function.

> The Write Method takes a byte array. That's great for HTTP/2 which is a binary protocol, unlike HTTP.

In our case, we want to return a UTF-8 String. Gladly, this isn't C (even if it looks like it is) and the byte array type has a very convenient interface for converting our String to a byte array: `[]byte("string here")`.

Now we stick the Parts together:

```go
package main

import "net/http"

func sayHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("Hi"))
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/say", sayHandler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":4000", nil)
}
```

Testing it with `curl`:

```bash
$ curl localhost:4000/say
Hi%
```

## Step 2 - Processing Input-Data


The Web and HTTP(S)(/2) is a core construct in Go; actually, golang was made for Web Development and Networking.

Of course, it comes with parsing functions for URL and POST/PATCH/PUT Body.

`Request.FormValue(key String)` returns a String with the Value of the Key.

We exchange the static "Hi" with the String we read from a Requests URL or Body.

```go
func sayHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
 w.Write([]byte(r.FormValue("name")))

}
```

Test: `curl` (or open it in any web browser)

```bash
$ curl localhost:4000/say -d 'name=Florian'
Florian%+
```

For our Application, we need another Parameter `message`.

> Usually, in golang, you would create a [`struct`](https://gobyexample.com/structs) now. However, this is not a golang tutorial, let's keep it simple.

```go
func sayHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    name := r.FormValue("name")
    message := r.FormValue("message")

     w.Write([]byte(name + " " + message))
}
```

## Step 3 - Implementing the `/listen` Handler

For the `listenHandler` we do the same as we did for the `sayHandler`, but without parsing any input. 
We instead tell the Client that the connection should be kept alive.

We create a new Handler `listenHandler` and set the **HTTP Header "Connection" to "keep-alive"** to tell the Client not to terminate the Connection. Also, we set **HTTP Header "Content-Type" to "text/event-stream"**.

To make sure that we are not Terminating the Connection from our side early, we wait for the Close event of the Client.

```go
//......
func listenHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Connection", "keep-alive")
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/event-stream")
    
    select {
        case <-r.Context().Done():
            return;
    }
}
//......
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/listen", listenHandler)
    //......
}
```

The Arrow Syntax "<-" belongs to one of the core concepts of concurrency in golang: `channel`s, it blocks the routine until it receives data from a `channel`.

> A `channel` in go is a typed conduit that can receive data `channel <- data` and data can be read from `data <- channel` Writing to or Reading from a Channel BLOCKS the subroutine. [Example](https://gobyexample.com/channels)

## Step 4 - Connecting the Handlers

We have a `/say` Endpoint, receiving Data from the Client. And a `/listen` Endpoint supposed to send the data we receive on `/say` to connected clients.

Now let us combine those. To do that, we need a new `channel` for every listener connected to send the data; we list them in a global map of channels like so:

`var messageChannels = make(map[chan []byte]bool)`

> (FAQ) I use a Map because in the later use of the Series we will have multiple Event Types.

### listenerHandler

Now every new Listener should create his messageChannel:

```go
_messageChannel := make(chan []byte)
```

And then, list it to the messageChannels Map:

```go
messageChannels[_messageChannel] = true
```

In the `select` statement of the `listenHandler`, we are **already waiting for Data coming from the Requests Close `channel`** before we return the function and end the Connection.

Now, we create another `case` in the select, which will be **waiting for Data from the `messageChannel`** and write the data into the ResponseWriter Stream.

```go
func listenHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Header().Set("Connection", "keep-alive")

	_messageChannel := make(chan []byte)
	messageChannels[_messageChannel] =  true

	for {
		select {
			case _msg := <- _messageChannel:
				w.Write(append(_msg,[]byte("\r\n")...))
				w.(http.Flusher).Flush()
			case <-r.Context().Done():
				delete(messageChannels, _messageChannel)
				return;
		}
	}
}
```

> `w.(http.Flusher).Flush()` flushs buffered data to the client explicitly. (be aware of proxy handling here if in a real world app)

### sayHandler

In the sayHandler we write to the `messageChannels` the listeners added. We do this in a dedicated thread, so we don't let the client wait till we channelled and processed all the data.

Since *concurrency is the core concept of golang*, the keyword for creating a new thread is **`go`**.

```go
// sayHandler Function
    // ...
    //old: w.Write([]byte(name + " " + message))
    go func() {
        for messageChannel := range messageChannels {
            messageChannel <- []byte(name + " " + message)
        }
    }()
    w.Write([]byte("ok"))
```

> pay attention to the `}()`: We are creating an instantly invoking the function. 

## Conclusion

We just built a real-time Chat app in 45 Lines of Go.

The `/say` endpoint processes `name` and `message`.
The `/listen` endpoint *keep-alive*s Connections and forwards input from `/say`

Test it with `curl` or visit localhost:4000/listen at your favourite web browser and send events with curl /say in Terminal!

> Disclaimer: This is not production Ready Code, for simplicity reason we omitted all the Error Checking and Input Sanitization

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

var messageChannels = make(map[chan []byte]bool)

func sayHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	name := r.FormValue("name")
	message := r.FormValue("message")

	go func() {
		for messageChannel := range messageChannels {
			messageChannel <- []byte(name + " " + message + "\r\n")
		}
	}()

	w.Write([]byte("ok."))
}

func listenHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Header().Set("Connection", "keep-alive")
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/event-stream")

	_messageChannel := make(chan []byte)
	messageChannels[_messageChannel] = true

	for {
		select {
		case _msg := <-_messageChannel:
			w.Write(_msg)
			w.(http.Flusher).Flush()
		case <-r.Context().Done():
			delete(messageChannels, _messageChannel)
			return
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/say", sayHandler)
	http.HandleFunc("/listen", listenHandler)

	log.Println("Running at :4000")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":4000", nil))
}
```

In the next Part, we will build the Server-Sent-Event Protocol ourself and connect it to a JavaScript Client for Real-time Browser Action.
