# Real-time Applications with Go and ReactJS: Implementing the SSE Protocol (Part 2)

## About the Series

Welcome to the first Part of a Series of Tutorials called **Real-time Applications with Go and ReactJS**. We build a Live Dashboard that Monitors Servers and receives Webhooks by GitlabCI (or any CI really), rendering this Data live to every Client that is connected **without any delay**.

After the Series, this is what the App will look like:

[![../assets/real-time-apps-with-go-and-reactjs.gif](../assets/real-time-apps-with-go-and-reactjs.gif)](../assets/real-time-apps-with-go-and-reactjs.mp4)

We are going to cover every step from an empty text editor to configuring your CI for the dashboard and deploy the docker container we build.

**Technologies covered**

-   GoLang for the Server
    
-   HTTP/2 and Server-Sent Events (SSE)
    
-   ReactJS for the Client
    
-   Docker for Building the App and Deploying it

## What are SSE (Server-Sent Events)?

With SSE it is possible, to push Data to a Client by keeping-alive the connection and telling the web browser that we sent data formatted as an `text/event-stream` (Covered in Part1)

[SSE is a Standard defined in the HTML Spec.](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) it describes precisely how to push data and which keywords are available.

On Browser-Side it implements an `EventSource` class that handles the data stream.

> SSE Data is always encoded as UTF-8, I am not aware of any implementation to change that. (Suggestions Welcome)

It's a living standard, so be prepared that things might change.
 Most modern web browsers can handle SSE; as so often, our favorite browsers Internet Explorer, and Edge do not. However, there are polyfills available.

> **Natively Server-Sent Events have a [Coverage of about 88%](https://caniuse.com/#search=Server%20Sent%20Events), with polyfills it is >95% and can be considered production ready.**

## Step 1: Learning about the SSE Protocol

We extend the Server we've built in the last Part to send conform data according to the SSE Standard.

**Essentials**

1.  The Protocol knows 4 keywords:
    

-   `id: {int}\n` (optional)
    
-   `retry: {int}\n` (optional)
    
-   `event: {string}\n` (optional, defaults to 'message')
    
-   `data: {string}\n`
    

2.  Multiline data has to begin with `data:`
    
3.  Every event has to end with a double endline `\n\n`
    

Example of a Message with JSON Data:

```textfile
retry: 100
event: newmessage
data: {"author": "Someone",
data: "message": "Something"}
```

## Step 2: Creating a Function to form valid SSE Push Data

We create a function `formatSSE` that takes two Arguments:

1.  a string that represents the event-name
    
2.  a string for the data
    

The return value will be a []byte array because that's what our `Write` function processes.

```go
formatSSE(event string, data string) []byte
```

In the functions body we go through the Protocol, step by step:

**Writing the Event-Name**
Initializing a payload variable with the event name, closing by with a new line.

```go
payload := "event: " + event + "\n"
```

**Splitting the Data by Line (Essentials 2)**
Multi Line Data needs to begin with `data:` on every line. First, we split the lines by their line-breaks into an array. **

```go
dataLines := strings.Split(data, "\n")
```

Then we loop over the array and add the `data: ` entries one by one to our payload.

```go
for _, line := range dataLines {
 eventPayload = eventPayload + "data: " + line + "\n"
 }
```

**Returning Data, ending the EventStream Chunk (Essentials 3)**
Before converting the eventPayload string to a []byte type, we append one more newline. *(Essentials 3)*

return []byte(eventPayload + "\n")

The function we just built:

```go
func formatSSE(event string, data string) []byte {
    eventPayload := "event: " + event + "\n"
    dataLines := strings.Split(data, "\n")
    for _, line := range dataLines {
        eventPayload = eventPayload + "data: " + line + "\n"
    }
    return []byte(eventPayload + "\n")
}
```

## Step 3: Encoding JSON in the `/say` Handler

We are dealing with JavaScript on the Client Side this time, so it is a good Idea to send JSON Formatted Data. The core module `encoding/json` will provides us a "Marshal" function that exerts multiple interfaces and returns a `[]byte`.

```go
import "encoding/json"
```

In the `sayHandler` we raise a JSON Structure out of the name and message we receive and write it to the message channel instead of the plain text we had before:

```go
func sayHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

    name := r.FormValue("name")
    message := r.FormValue("message")

    jsonStructure, _err := json.Marshal(map[string]string{
        "name": name,
        "message": message})
//......
    messageChannel <- []byte(jsonStructure)
```

## Step 4: Using the `formatSSE` function in the `/listen` handler

Since we already implemented all the logic needed for a simple SSE Server, we only need to change the `Write` method to take the return value from our `formatSSE` Function instead of plain data.

```go
        case _msg := <-_messageChannel:
            w.Write([]byte(formatSSE("message", string(_msg))))
            w.(http.Flusher).Flush()
```

You can try it out with the same curl commands we used earlier:
`curl localhost:4000/listen` to add a listener
`curl http://localhost:4000/say -d "name=Florian&message=A new Message"` sending data

You should see an Output like that on your Listener:

```textfile
event: message
data: {"name":"Florian","message":"A new Message"}
```

### Step 5: Getting the Browser involved

The real browser side is covered in the following two parts, but to test an HTML5 spec protocol we probably won't get around involving the browser early.

`touch test.html`

Moreover, add the following example script to any html page:

```javascript
    let eventListener = new EventSource("http://localhost:4000/listen")
    eventListener.onmessage = (event) => {
        let {type, data} = event
        alert(`Received ${event} event with data: ${data}`)
    }
```

> Attention: Depending on your local Setup you might need cors headers to work correctly. The simple fix is to add `w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")` at the beginning of your `listenFunc`.

**curl http://localhost:4000/say -d "name=Florian&message=A new Message"`** open an alert-window with the **Data displayed in the Browser**.

## Conclusion

We implemented a working SSE Protocol from Scratch. You should now understand what SSE is and how it is working. That's a great start to do something with it!
